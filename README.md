This project uses the Creation Kit for Fallout 4 as well as some extra plugins to help me practice modding as I'm going
all you have to do to import the file into Creation Kit is to first get the folder into your data folder in common\steamapps\Fallout 4\Data for example.
then open up Creation Kit and click the file in the top left to import plugins and other such files, for a basic mod such as this just double click the fallout 4 master file and the plugins name
set the plugin as the active file; and there you go that's how to open and start editing the creation kit plugin
